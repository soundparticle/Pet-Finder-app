# app
Front end for Pet Finder rehoming app.
My contributions included unit and e2e testing on the backend, writing the Seeker schema, writing code for the routes, the api, auth, and store files. I wrote our error handling and middleware. I fixed some naming issues we found in some of the other schemas so I updated those and made sure the tests still passed. I was involved with quite a bit of the css styling. 

## Languages/Frameworks
Uses React/Redux on the front. Node, Jest for TDD testing and for the backend.
