My contributions included unit and e2e testing on the backend, writing the Seeker schema, writing code for the routes, the api, auth, and store files. I wrote our error handling and middleware. I fixed some naming issues we found in some of the other schemas so I updated those and made sure the tests still passed. I was involved with quite a bit of the css styling. 

## Languages/Frameworks
Uses React/Redux on the front. Node, Jest for TDD testing and for the backend.
